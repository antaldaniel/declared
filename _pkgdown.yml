    desc: >
      This package is in an early development phase, but fully functional and
      extensively tested. The current dataset S3 class is inherited
      from the base R data.frame, but it equally works with the modern
      [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), which carries a larger dependency
      footprint. Easy interoperability with the [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
      package--which provides an R interface to the
      [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) JavaScript library--is a development
      priority.
