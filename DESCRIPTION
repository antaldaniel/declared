Description: A set of functions to declare labels and missing values, coupled
    with associated functions to create (weighted) tables of frequencies and
    various other summary measures. 
    Some of the base functions have been rewritten to make use of the specific 
    information about the missing values, most importantly to distinguish
    between empty and declared missing values.
    Many functions have a similar functionality with the corresponding ones from
    packages "haven" and "labelled". A lot of effort was spent to ensure as much
    compatibility as possible with these packages, with the intention to offer
    an alternative in the objects of class "declared".
